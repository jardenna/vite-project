          WCAG 3.0 is unlikely to move out of draft status before 2025 at the
          very earliest, and quite probably a few years later than that. Apart
          from naming conventions and document structure, the main differences
          between WCAG 2 and WCAG 3 are: Changing the focus from web content to
          all digital products Putting greater emphasis on critical errors in
          relation to each guideline Ranking test results on a percentage scale
          rather than pass / fail Including usability testing with users and
          assistive technologies Making methods, testing, and scoring
          technology-specific where appropriate Including user agent and
          authoring tool conformance Factoring in the specific functional needs
          of people with disabilities Requiring user generated content to be
          conformant https://www.tpgi.com/wcag-3-0-are-we-there-yet/
