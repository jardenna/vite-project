          By tying up aria properties with styles (instead of adding custom
          classes) we ensure that other developers will most likely keep the
          aria values up to date. Otherwise, an engineer who is not experienced
          with accessibility might forget to update those values when
          refactoring the component.

        Myth number two, making digital assets accessible is costly and time
        Myth number three Only a small percentage of the global population is
        living with a disability. OK, according to WHO the World Health
        Organization, about 15% of the global population is living with some
        form of disability, but they only take into account those living with
        permanent disabilities. If you included the people who in who experience
        temporary and situational disabilities, that number jumps to 100%.
        Digital accessibility helps more people than you might realize, like
        when you design accessibly for a person with some form of
        colorblindness, you're also helping people who have aging eyes or who
        are experiencing screen glare. You know, when you design for someone
        with permanent cognitive impairment, you're making the experience easier
        for your coworker who had a few too many last night and might be moving
        a bit slow this morning when you have tested for the proper tab order.
        For people who can't use a mouse due to maybe hand tremors, you're also
        helping out the middle school kid who broke their dominant arm designed
        for the 15%, and you create better experiences for everyone.
